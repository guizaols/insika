## Scorecard B — out of the box (each harness as it ships)

| Harness | Cells | Passed | Rate | Time p50 | Time p95 | Tokens/success | Cost/success | Failure classes | Not measured |

## How to read the numbers

Time is wall clock measured by the runner around each turn, summed over the task — never self-reported. It includes the adapter's own process spawn, which every entrant pays, ours included; p50 is the honest column and p95 is where a harness that retries silently shows up.

Cost per success is blank for a harness that reports no token usage, and blank is the truth: an assumed zero would put the harness that measures nothing at the top of the column.


Every cell traces to a run log under `confirmation-true/`.
